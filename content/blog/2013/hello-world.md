Summary: Wherein the new magically.us, a personal website powered by Pelican, is introduced by its creator.  

### Prologue
Good day to you, dear reader!  Welcome to magically.us, the personal website of [Kevin Richardson](http://github.com/kfr2), a software engineer and developer of web experiences.  Herein I will write about various things I find interesting as well as any revelations I have while developing different pieces of software or user experiences.  Although I currently work predominantly as a web developer (mostly with the lovely [Django](http://djangoproject.com) framework), my personal and business work touches upon many facets and technologies.  Thus, my posts will not be strictly related to web development but may be very exploratory in nature.

### The technology behind this site
This site is powered by [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) -- a static website generator  -- and is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/kfr2/kfr2.github.com) using [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/).  Content is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a lightweight markup language that allows one to easily add syntax like headings, anchors, and lists to a page.  I use OSX and [Mou](http://mouapp.com/), the "missing Markdown editor for web developers", to develop and write the various content contained on this site.

If you desire your own personal site, I highly recommend a similar setup as the workflow for adding content to this site is quite easy if you are familiar with GitHub and Python.  If you're not (and desire to setup a similar website), fret not -- I will soon write a post describing how one can setup her own installation of Pelican with GitHub pages.

### Epilogue
Thank you very much for perusing my small corner of the web.  If you already haven't, you may be interested in viewing [a list of my projects](/pages/projects.html) or [my GitHub account](https://github.com/kfr2).  Furthermore, please feel free to contact me using the methods listed in [my humans.txt file](/humans.txt) as I would love to discuss Life, the Universe, and Everything with you.

*Pax et bonum: peace and good.*
